# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials: Summary

## Overview üìñ

Welcome to the **Summary Module**. This module appears at the end of each section and serves as a recap of the key points covered in the preceding lessons. Think of it as a quick review to sharpen your understanding before moving forward.

### Recap of Key Points üß≠

Let's summarize the main topics we've covered so far:

1. **Coffee Shop Scenario**:
   - Introduced a coffee shop scenario to illustrate the client-server model and the flexibility of cloud computing.
   - Used this analogy to explain concepts like on-demand provisioning, pay-as-you-go pricing, and scalability.

2. **Introduction to Cloud Computing**:
   - Defined cloud computing as the on-demand use of IT resources over the internet, with pricing based on usage.
   - Highlighted the benefits of cloud computing, such as flexibility, cost efficiency, and focus on core business activities.

3. **Deployment Models for Cloud Computing**:
   - Discussed three primary deployment models:
     - **Cloud-Based Deployment**: Design, build, and run applications entirely in the cloud.
     - **On-Premises Deployment**: Deploy resources in a private data center for greater control and customization.
     - **Hybrid Deployment**: Combine cloud-based and on-premises resources for flexibility and compliance.

4. **Benefits of Cloud Computing**:
   - Explored the advantages of cloud computing, including:
     - Converting upfront expenses to variable costs.
     - Eliminating data center management and maintenance costs.
     - Avoiding the need to guess capacity needs.
     - Leveraging massive economies of scale.
     - Increasing speed and agility.
     - Going global in minutes with low latency.
