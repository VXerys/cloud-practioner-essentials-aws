# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials: Cloud Computing

## Introduction üåê

Before delving deeper into AWS, let's narrow down the scope of our discussion to the definition and workings of cloud computing.

### What Comes to Mind When You Hear "Cloud"? üå¶Ô∏è
When you hear the word "cloud," do you imagine fluffy clouds in the sky? That's not far off. Many network diagrams use cloud symbols to represent the internet, symbolizing that data exists somewhere out there, floating, wireless, and accessible anytime and anywhere [[2]].

### What is Cloud Computing? üöÄ
According to AWS, cloud computing‚Äîor **computation cloud**‚Äîis the on-demand use of IT resources over the internet, with pricing based on usage (pay-as-you-go) [[3]]. Let's break down this definition:

1. **On-Demand Usage**: AWS provides the IT resources you need, whenever and wherever you need them. You don't need to inform AWS in advance about your requirements.
   - Need 300 virtual servers? Just click a few buttons, and they're ready.
   - Need 2000 TB of storage? Use it as needed, and release it when done.

2. **IT Resources**: AWS offers hundreds of services, covering everything from compute, storage, databases, networking, and more. These services are designed to handle common IT tasks, freeing you to focus on your business.

3. **Access via Internet**: You can access these resources through a web browser or programmatically, without the need for contracts or long-term commitments. Just pay for what you use, similar to hiring staff only during peak hours at a coffee shop.

### Why Cloud Computing? ‚öôÔ∏è
Before cloud computing, companies had to build and maintain their own data centers. This involved significant upfront investments and ongoing costs for building, staffing, and maintaining physical infrastructure. Additionally, companies had to predict workload demands accurately, which was often challenging and led to inefficiencies.

#### Challenges of Traditional Data Centers:
- **High Costs**: Building and maintaining data centers require substantial financial resources.
- **Predicting Workload**: Estimating future workloads is difficult, leading to either under-provisioning or over-provisioning.
- **Scalability Issues**: Handling sudden spikes in traffic (like on holidays) can overwhelm traditional data centers, causing downtime.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing:
- **Flexibility**: Scale resources up or down based on demand.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for what you use, eliminating unnecessary expenses.
- **Focus on Core Business**: Automate routine IT tasks, allowing teams to concentrate on strategic initiatives.

### Example: Managing Website Traffic üåê
Imagine a company with a website that typically sees 10,000 daily visitors, dropping to 5,000 on weekends. However, during special events like New Year's Eve, traffic spikes to 30,000 visitors, causing the site to crash. With cloud computing, you can easily adjust resources to match the workload, ensuring smooth performance without over-provisioning.
