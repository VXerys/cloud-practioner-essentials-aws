# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials: Global Networking

## Overview üåê

In this module, we will explore how customers interact with AWS infrastructure. Specifically, we will focus on DNS (Domain Name System) and how AWS services like **Amazon Route 53** and **Amazon CloudFront** facilitate global connectivity and content delivery.

## Domain Name System (DNS) üåê

### What is DNS?
- **Definition**: DNS translates domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 80.17.25.131) that computers can understand.
- **Analogy**: Think of DNS as a phone book for the internet, mapping human-readable domain names to machine-readable IP addresses.

### How DNS Works:
1. **User Request**: A user enters a domain name (e.g., www.example.com) into a browser.
2. **DNS Query**: The request is sent to a DNS resolver (often provided by the user's ISP).
3. **Lookup**: The DNS resolver queries a DNS server (such as Amazon Route 53) to find the corresponding IP address.
4. **Response**: The DNS server responds with the IP address.
5. **Routing**: The browser uses the IP address to route the request to the correct server.

### Example Scenario:
- **Website Access**: When you visit www.example.com, DNS resolves the domain name to an IP address, allowing your browser to connect to the correct server.

## Amazon Route 53 üåê

### What is Amazon Route 53?
- **Definition**: Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable DNS service that routes traffic to AWS resources or external endpoints.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Global Reach**: Routes traffic to AWS resources like EC2 instances, load balancers, or external servers.
  - **Routing Policies**: Supports various routing policies to optimize traffic distribution.
    - **Latency-Based Routing**: Routes traffic to the closest endpoint based on latency.
    - **Geolocation Routing**: Routes traffic based on the geographical location of the user.
    - **Geoproximity Routing**: Routes traffic to the nearest AWS Region.
    - **Weighted Round Robin**: Distributes traffic based on specified weights.
  - **Domain Registration**: Allows you to register and manage domain names.

### Example Scenario:
- **Geolocation DNS**: Route traffic from Indonesian users to the Singapore Region and Japanese users to the Tokyo Region.

### Integration:
- **AWS Services**: Route 53 integrates with other AWS services like AWS WAF, AWS Certificate Manager, and Amazon CloudFront to provide a comprehensive solution.

## Amazon CloudFront üåê

### What is Amazon CloudFront?
- **Definition**: Amazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers with low latency and high transfer speeds.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Edge Locations**: Distributes content to Edge locations around the world, bringing content closer to users.
  - **Integration**: Integrates with other AWS services like AWS WAF, AWS Certificate Manager, Amazon Route 53, and Amazon S3.
  - **Ease of Use**: Quick setup using AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDK.

### Example Scenario:
- **Content Delivery**: Distributes static assets (images, videos, CSS, JavaScript) from Edge locations to users, reducing latency and improving performance.

## Case Study: Amazon Route 53 and Amazon CloudFront Collaboration üåê

### Scenario:
Imagine you have an application running on multiple Amazon EC2 instances within an Auto Scaling group, attached to an Application Load Balancer.

### Workflow:
1. **User Request**: A user enters the website address in their browser.
2. **DNS Resolution**: The request is sent to Amazon Route 53 to resolve the domain name to an IP address.
3. **Traffic Routing**: Route 53 routes the traffic to the nearest Edge location using CloudFront.
4. **Content Delivery**: CloudFront retrieves the content from the nearest Edge location and sends it to the user.
5. **Backend Processing**: If the content is not cached, CloudFront forwards the request to the Application Load Balancer.
6. **Application Processing**: The Application Load Balancer distributes the request to the appropriate EC2 instance.
7. **Response**: The processed content is returned to the user, completing the request.

### Benefits:
- **Speed**: Reduced latency due to content being served from Edge locations.
- **Reliability**: High availability ensured by Route 53 and CloudFront.
- **Security**: Enhanced security features like AWS WAF and SSL/TLS.
