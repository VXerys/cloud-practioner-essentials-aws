## Introduction to Global Infrastructure and Reliability üåç

Welcome to this module! Let's start by discussing **high availability (HA)**.

### Scenario: Parade in Front of the Coffee Shop üöó
Imagine your customers want to enjoy a warm latte at our coffee shop. Unfortunately, a parade celebrating the success of cloud migration is blocking the road in front of the shop. While this might be visually appealing, it poses a challenge for our business. Customers who would have visited the shop are redirected, leading to disappointment and reduced sales.

But fear not! We've anticipated this situation. Our coffee shop isn't limited to a single location‚Äîit has branches scattered across the city. This ensures that even if one shop is inaccessible due to the parade, customers can visit another nearby branch. They can still enjoy their latte, and we can continue operating smoothly.

### AWS Global Infrastructure üåê
AWS has implemented a similar strategy with its **global infrastructure**. By distributing resources across multiple locations, AWS ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

### Key Concepts üìò

#### High Availability (HA) üåÄ
- **Definition**: Ensures that systems are always available and accessible with minimal downtime, without human intervention.
- **Importance**: Critical for maintaining business continuity and customer satisfaction.

#### Fault Tolerance üõ†Ô∏è
- **Definition**: Ability of a system to continue operating even if some components fail.
- **Importance**: Reduces the risk of complete system failure due to individual component issues.

### AWS Regions and Availability Zones üó∫Ô∏è
AWS operates in multiple geographic locations called **Regions**. Within each Region, there are multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)**. These AZs are physically isolated but interconnected, ensuring redundancy and fault tolerance.

#### Benefits of Global Infrastructure:
- **Redundancy**: Multiple locations prevent total system failure if one location goes down.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Systems can continue operating even if some components fail.
- **Improved Performance**: Closer proximity to users reduces latency and improves response times.

## Availability Zones (AZs) üè¢

### What is an Availability Zone?
- **Definition**: A distinct location within an AWS Region that is insulated from failures in other AZs.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Physically separated from other AZs to minimize the impact of regional events (e.g., power outages, natural disasters).
  - Connected via high-speed, low-latency network links.
  - Each AZ has its own independent power, cooling, and networking.

### Benefits of AZs:
- **Redundancy**: If one AZ fails, others can take over without interruption.
- **Isolation**: Failures in one AZ do not affect others, ensuring continued operation.
- **Performance**: Applications can be distributed across AZs to optimize performance and availability.

## Amazon CloudFront and Edge Locations üåê

### Amazon CloudFront
- **Overview**: A global content delivery network (CDN) that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Edge Locations**: Distributed points of presence (PoPs) around the world that cache content closer to users.
  - **Global Reach**: CloudFront can deliver content to users in any part of the world with minimal latency.
  - **Security**: Provides secure delivery of content using HTTPS and SSL/TLS.

### Benefits of CloudFront:
- **Reduced Latency**: Content is cached closer to users, improving load times.
- **Enhanced Security**: Secure delivery of content with encryption and authentication.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for what you use, with no minimum fees.

## Comparing Delivery Methods üîÑ

AWS offers several methods for delivering services globally, each with its own advantages:

### 1. **Direct Connection to a Single Region**
- **Pros**: Simple setup, straightforward management.
- **Cons**: Potential for high latency and downtime if the region fails.

### 2. **Multiple Regions with Availability Zones**
- **Pros**: Redundancy and fault tolerance, lower latency.
- **Cons**: More complex setup and management.

### 3. **Global Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
- **Pros**: Low latency, high availability, secure delivery.
- **Cons**: Additional costs for CDN usage.
